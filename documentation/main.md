#Documentation

This is a guide to document how this website measures and tracks implementation of [Project Open Data](http://project-open-data.github.com/) as well as other tools and resources it provides to help agencies implement their open data programs. 

##Agency Dashboard

The [Agency Dashboard](http://labs.data.gov/dashboard/offices) is used to track how agencies are implementing [Project Open Data](http://project-open-data.github.com/) (aka [OMB M-13-13](http://project-open-data.github.io/policy-memo/)). This is done in two ways: 

1. Review of the [leading indicators](#leading_indicators) (detailed below) by OMB staff
2. [Automated metrics](#automated_metrics) that analyze machine readable files (eg, data.json, digitalstrategy.json)

The leading indicators are scored by OMB staff and they can involve a more subjective evaluation process. The indicators are also informed by the automated metrics which are generated by a daily automated script that analyzes files on agency websites to understand the progress and current status of their public data listings.

###Milestones

The dashboard is oriented around quarterly milestones. You can use  the blue milestone selection menu to navigate between milestones. The OMB scoring as well as the automated metrics are always tied to a specific milestone. The automated metrics will update every 24 hours until the end of the quarter when the milestone has been reached. At that point those automated metrics will represent a historical snapshot. To see the most current automated metrics, you'll need to view the current quarter (the next approaching milestone).

###Leading Indicators Strategy

The "Leading Indicators Strategy" refers to the five categories of indicators drawn from the [Cross Agency Priority Goals (CAP Goals) for Open Data](http://www.performance.gov/node/3396?view=public#overview). The strategies are based on the [Enterprise Data Inventory](#enterprise_data_inventory), the [Public Data Listing](#public_data_listing), [Public Engagement](#public_engagement), [Privacy & Security](#privacy_and_security), and [Human Capital](#human_capital) and are all detailed below.

###Leading Indicators

The Leading Indicators Strategies described above are broken down here into their component parts:

<a name="automated_metrics"></a>
###Automated Metrics
These fields are determined by an automated script that runs every night to analyze agency data.json, digitalstrategy.json, and /data files. 

<a name="pdl_expected_url"></a>
####Expected URL

This is the URL where the data.json file is expected to be found. This is based on the main agency URL provided through the [USA.gov Directory API](http://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/federal-agency-directory/)

<a name="pdl_resolved_url"></a>
####Resolved URL

This is the URL that is resolved after following any redirects.

<a name="pdl_redirects"></a>
####Redirects

This is the number of redirects used to reach the final data.json URL. Currently this is only set to follow 5 redirects before stopping.

Ideally this should be 0

<a name="pdl_http_code"></a>
####HTTP Status

This is the [HTTP status code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_status_codes) received when attempting to reach the expected or resolved URL. For more information on properly using HTTP status codes, see: [Knowing Your HTTP Status Codes In Federal Government](http://kinlane.com/2013/11/06/knowing-your-http-status-codes-in-federal-government/)

This should be 200 it the data.json or /data URL was found successfully.

<a name="pdl_http_content_type"></a>
####Content-Type

The [Content-Type](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-Type) is how the server announces the type of file it is serving at the requested URL. Usually it won't break anything if this is set incorrectly, but some applications may need to be set to force it to be read as JSON even if it announces it's something else. This is very similiar to how a file extension on a file identifies the file type. Yes, the URL says data.json, but the browser just sees that as an arbitrary URL. The Content-Type is what identifies the actual file type. Setting this incorrectly would be like if you had a file named graph.pdf that was actually a CSV spreadsheet file.

The [character encoding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding) should also be specified as part of the Content-Type. This encoding should match the actual encoding of the text in the file. The correct character encoding for [JSON](http://json.org/) is always unicode, preferably [UTF-8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utf-8).

For data.json this should be: `application/json; charset=utf-8`

For /data this should be: `text/html; charset=utf-8`

<a name="pdl_valid_json"></a>
####Valid JSON

This identifies whether the data.json was actually JSON. Even if the HTTP Status is 200 for the data.json URL and the Content-Type announces it's application/json; charset=UTF-8 the response might actually be HTML or improperly formatted JSON. You can check how well formed your JSON is with a tool like [JSONLint](http://jsonlint.com/). When using this tool it is best to enter the URL of the JSON file rather than copying and pasting the JSON. This is because when you copy and paste the raw JSON, your browser may attempt ot automtically fix problems that the server will not know to fix when it retrieves the file directly.

<a name="pdl_valid_schema"></a>
####Valid Schema

This identifies whether the data.json has all the required fields and has values that fit within the parameters specified by the [data.json schema metadata](http://project-open-data.github.io/schema/). This is validated using the rules codified within a [JSON Schema document](https://github.com/project-open-data/project-open-data.github.io/tree/master/schema/1_0_final) hosted on Project Open Data.

The validator hosted by HHS provides even more detailed analysis: http://hub.healthdata.gov/pod/validate
